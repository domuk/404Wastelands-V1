The next step will change depending on how you host your server.

* Open the server.bat and edit the "IP=x.x.x.x" and you should be able to instantly launch the server.
* Login to your hosted control panel and on the game server and you will need to change the command line so that it loads "-mod=@Arma2NET"

Troubleshooting

* We had trouble getting battleye to start up with the server which meant we couldn't run Arma2 Rcon admin on the server. If you are having problems after setting your rcon password, then you might want to add the following to your startup "-bepath=C:\PATH\TO\BattlEye"We moved battleye into the wasteland folder on our server and pointed it to that.If you have any problems setting up your server, we will help you the best we can but cannot guarantee that your host/server will work as each setup varies. For support please use the 404games tech support forum located here http://www.404games....hnical-support/
* If you are getting waiting for host or the game is not loading correctly please make sure that you have copyied the "Addons" folder from Arma2 to your Arma2OA folder as it contains lots of the servers requirements. (Guide Link Coming Soon)
* If missions are running then randomly stopping please make sure that you have updated your build to the latest version of wastelands as we released a hotfix to fix a broken mission.
* If missions are not running and you have Arma2Net running please make sure you have installed the two following requirements of arma2net. http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=24872 and http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8328
